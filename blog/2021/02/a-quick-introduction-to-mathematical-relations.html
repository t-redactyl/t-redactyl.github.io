        </div>
        <p>An important way of thinking about a set is seeing how the elements are related to each other. For example, some elements of a set might be less than others, some might be equal, and some might belong together because they are&nbsp;even. </p>
<p>For example, let&#8217;s say we have the set of all natural numbers, <span class="math">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span>. Some of the elements of <span class="math">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span> are related because <span class="math">\(xy = 18\)</span> (also known as the factors of 18). If we list them out, we&nbsp;get:
</p>
<div class="math">$$\{(1, 18), (2, 9), (3, 6), (6, 3), (9, 2), (18, 1)\}$$</div>
<p>You probably immediately noticed a number of things about this group. Firstly, this is a set; specifically, a subset of <span class="math">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span>. Secondly, it consists of all of the ordered pairs of <span class="math">\(x \in \mathbb{N}\)</span> that satisfy the rule <span class="math">\(xy = 18\)</span>. This concept is called a relation, which in informal terms is just a set of ordered pairs of all of the members of our set of interest that conform to some rule or relationship or function. In more formal terms, for <span class="math">\(x, y \in\)</span> set <span class="math">\(X\)</span>, the relation <span class="math">\(\mathrel{R}\)</span> includes all members of <span class="math">\(X\)</span> where <span class="math">\(x\mathrel{R}y\)</span>. </p>
<h2>Properties of&nbsp;relations</h2>
<p>Relations have a number of properties. The first is that a relation <span class="math">\(\mathrel{R}\)</span> can be <strong>reflexive</strong>. This means that for a set <span class="math">\(A\)</span>, a <span class="math">\(\mathrel{R}\)</span> is reflexive if <span class="math">\(x\mathrel{R}x\)</span> is true for all elements of <span class="math">\(A\)</span>. Some examples of this are the equality relation, where <span class="math">\(x = x\)</span> is true, and the relation where the addition of the members is even, where <span class="math">\(x + x\)</span> will be even if <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is&nbsp;even.</p>
<p>The second property is that a relation can be <strong>symmetric</strong>. This means that if <span class="math">\(x\mathrel{R}y\)</span> is true, then <span class="math">\(y\mathrel{R}x\)</span> is also true. Some examples of this are <span class="math">\(x + y\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(y + x\)</span> is also true, and <span class="math">\(x \cdot y\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(y \cdot x\)</span> is also&nbsp;true.</p>
<p>The final property is that a relation can be <strong>transitive</strong>. This means that if <span class="math">\(x\mathrel{R}y\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y\mathrel{R}z\)</span> is true, then <span class="math">\(x\mathrel{R}z\)</span> is also true. Some examples of this is the less than relation, where if <span class="math">\(x &lt; y\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y &lt; z\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(x &lt; z\)</span>, and similarly, the more than relation, where <span class="math">\(x &gt; y\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y &gt; z\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(x &gt; z\)</span>. </p>
<h2>Equivalence&nbsp;classes</h2>
<p>When a relation satisfies all three properties above: reflexivity, symmetry and transitivity, it is known as an equivalence relation. Equivalence relations have the special property in that they partition up the entire reference set into mutually exclusive groups called <strong>equivalence classes</strong>. More formally, the union of two equivalence classes is the empty set, so  <span class="math">\([a_1] \cap [a_2] = \emptyset\)</span>, and the intersection of every equivalence class in a reference set <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is <span class="math">\(A\)</span> itself, so <span class="math">\([a_1] \cup [a_2] \cup \ldots \cup [a_n] = A\)</span>. This is because if we have a relation <span class="math">\(x\mathrel{R}y\)</span> on a set <span class="math">\(A\)</span>, then every member within an equivalence class will be <span class="math">\(\mathrel{R}\)</span>-related to each other, and moreover, an equivalence class contains every member of <span class="math">\(A\)</span> that is <span class="math">\(\mathrel{R}\)</span>-related. </p>
<p>This is quite abstract, so let&#8217;s look at a more concrete example. Let&#8217;s make our reference set all prime numbers under 11,&nbsp;so: 
</p>
<div class="math">$$\{2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97\}$$</div>
<p> 
and define our relation <span class="math">\(x\mathrel{R}y\)</span> as <span class="math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y\)</span> having the same final digit. So 7 and 37 would be related, for&nbsp;instance. </p>
<p>We first need to check whether this is an equivalence relation. <span class="math">\(\mathrel{R}\)</span> is reflexive, because every number has the same final digit as itself. It&#8217;s also symmetric, as if <span class="math">\(x\)</span> has the same final digit as <span class="math">\(y\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(y\)</span> has the same final digit as <span class="math">\(x\)</span>. Finally, it&#8217;s transitive, as if <span class="math">\(x\)</span> has the same final digit as <span class="math">\(y\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(y\)</span> has the same final digit as <span class="math">\(z\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(x\)</span> of course has the same final digit as <span class="math">\(z\)</span>. All three properties being satisfied, we know that <span class="math">\(\mathrel{R}\)</span> is an equivalence&nbsp;relation.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start defining the equivalence classes. We&#8217;ll start with all of the pairs that end with 1. Our relation is <span class="math">\(P_1 = \{(11, 31), (11, 41), (11, 61), (11, 71), (31, 41), \ldots, (61, 71)\}\)</span>, and the corresponding equivalence class is <span class="math">\(C_1 = \{11, 31, 41, 61, 71\}\)</span>, or the subset of the elements of our reference set that are <span class="math">\(\mathrel{R}\)</span>-related. There are six possible digits that these prime numbers can end in, and we can make equivalence classes for them&nbsp;all:</p>
<div class="math">$$C_2 = \{2\}, \quad C_3 = \{3, 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, 83\}, \quad C_5 = \{5\},$$</div>
<div class="math">$$C_7 = \{7, 17, 37, 47, 67, 97\}, \quad C_9 = \{19, 29, 59, 79, 89\}$$</div>
<p>You can see that each of these subsets are mutally exclusive, and each element within each subset has the same final digit. However, we&#8217;re not quite there yet. The notation for naming equivalence classes is <span class="math">\([x]\)</span>, where <span class="math">\([x]\)</span> is simply the equivalence class that contains <span class="math">\(x\)</span>. So instead of calling our equivalence class containing those prime numbers ending in 1 <span class="math">\(C_1\)</span>, we could call it <span class="math">\([11]\)</span>. In fact, there is nothing special about 11. It would be equally valid to call this equivalence class <span class="math">\([31]\)</span>, <span class="math">\([41]\)</span>, <span class="math">\([61]\)</span> or <span class="math">\([71]\)</span>. As long as the name references one of the elements of the equivalence class, this is fine. This also means that <span class="math">\([11] = [31] = [41] = [61] = [71]\)</span>, as they all reference the same equivalence class <span class="math">\(\{11, 31, 41, 61, 71\}\)</span>.</p>
<h2>A more exotic&nbsp;example</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s finish up this post by looking at a more in-depth example. I&#8217;ll first lay out the question, then we&#8217;ll break it down and start solving&nbsp;it.</p>
<hr>
<p>Define the relation <span class="math">\(\mathrel{R}\)</span> on the set <span class="math">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span> by <span class="math">\(x\mathrel{R}y\)</span> if and only if there is some <span class="math">\(n \in \mathbb{Z}\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(x = 2^ny\)</span>. Prove that <span class="math">\(\mathrel{R}\)</span> is an equivalence relation. What are its equivalence&nbsp;classes?</p>
<hr>
<p>The first thing we need to note is that our reference set for the relation is <span class="math">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span>, the set of all natural numbers, and that the relation <span class="math">\(\mathrel{R}\)</span> is defined by <span class="math">\(x = 2^ny\)</span>. This means that for every <span class="math">\(x\)</span> in the natural numbers, there is some <span class="math">\(y\)</span> that can be multiplied by <span class="math">\(2^n\)</span> to get that number. Moreover, the <span class="math">\(n\)</span> in <span class="math">\(2^n\)</span> comes from the integers <span class="math">\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span>, so can use any integer from negative infinity to positive infinity. Some examples of this relation would be <span class="math">\(24 = 2^3 \cdot 3\)</span> and <span class="math">\(8 = 2^{-2} \cdot 32\)</span>. So in this problem, we need to find some <span class="math">\(n \in \mathbb{Z}\)</span> that will allow us to satisfy each of the properties that make up an equivalence&nbsp;relation.</p>
<p>Starting with reflexivity, we need to show that <span class="math">\(x = 2^nx\)</span> for some <span class="math">\(n \in \mathbb{Z}\)</span>. It&#8217;s clear that the only <span class="math">\(n\)</span> that will make this true is 0, as this will convert <span class="math">\(2^n\)</span> to 1, so that <span class="math">\(x = 2^0 \cdot x = 1 \cdot x = x\)</span>. So when <span class="math">\(n = 0\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\mathrel{R}\)</span> is&nbsp;reflexive.</p>
<p>Turning to symmetry, we want to show that if <span class="math">\(x\mathrel{R}y\)</span> is <span class="math">\(x = 2^ny\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(y\mathrel{R}x\)</span> is <span class="math">\(y = 2^mx\)</span>, where both <span class="math">\(n\)</span> and <span class="math">\(m\)</span> are integers. Notice that we don&#8217;t need to use the same integer for <span class="math">\(x\mathrel{R}y\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y\mathrel{R}x\)</span>; it just needs to be some number that meets the criteria for being an integer. To get <span class="math">\(y\mathrel{R}x\)</span>, we solve <span class="math">\(x = 2^ny\)</span> for <span class="math">\(y\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math">$$
\begin{aligned}
x &amp;= 2^ny \\
2^{-n} \cdot 2^n \cdot y &amp;= 2^{-n}x \\
2^{n - n}y &amp;= 2^{-n}x \\
2^0y &amp;= 2^{-n}x \\
1 \cdot y &amp;= 2^{-n}x \\
y &amp;= 2^{-n}x
\end{aligned}
$$</div>
<p>We now have <span class="math">\(-n\)</span> as our integer power for <span class="math">\(y\mathrel{R}x\)</span>, and as <span class="math">\(-n = -1 \cdot n\)</span>, it is also an integer. To make the leap to <span class="math">\(y = 2^mx\)</span>, we simply need to define <span class="math">\(m = -n\)</span>, and we have our proof. Therefore, <span class="math">\(\mathrel{R}\)</span> is also&nbsp;reflexive.</p>
<p>Finally, we need to show that <span class="math">\(\mathrel{R}\)</span> is transitive. Here, we assume that <span class="math">\(x\mathrel{R}y\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y\mathrel{R}z\)</span>, and we want to show that <span class="math">\(x\mathrel{R}z\)</span>. This means that we know that <span class="math">\(x = 2^ny\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y = 2^mz\)</span>, and we want to show that <span class="math">\(x = 2^kz\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(n, m\)</span> and <span class="math">\(k\)</span> are all integers. Again, note that these are not the same integers for each of the expressions. To solve this, we can substitute in our definition of <span class="math">\(y\)</span> into <span class="math">\(x = 2^ny\)</span>, and simplify&nbsp;this:</p>
<div class="math">$$
\begin{aligned}
x &amp;= 2^ny \\
&amp;= 2^n(2^mz) \\
&amp;= 2^{m + n}z
\end{aligned}
$$</div>
<p>We now have <span class="math">\(m + n\)</span> as our integer power for <span class="math">\(x\mathrel{R}z\)</span>, which as the sum of two integers is also an integer. Again, all we need to do to get to <span class="math">\(x = 2^kz\)</span> is define <span class="math">\(k = m + n\)</span>. We&#8217;ve now shown that if <span class="math">\(x\mathrel{R}y\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y\mathrel{R}z\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(x\mathrel{R}z\)</span>, so <span class="math">\(\mathrel{R}\)</span> is also&nbsp;transitive.</p>
<p>Finally, to get our equivalence classes on <span class="math">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span>, we define <span class="math">\(n\)</span> as the only integer that satisfied all three properties, 0. When <span class="math">\(n = 0\)</span>, <span class="math">\(x = y\)</span>, which is the same as the equality relation. As such every <span class="math">\(a \in \mathbb{N}\)</span> forms an equivalence class all by itself, i.e., <span class="math">\([a] = \{a\}\)</span>. For example, <span class="math">\([2] = \{2\}\)</span>, and <span class="math">\([64] = \{64\}\)</span>.</p>
<p>A lot of the material in this post was based on the book <a href="https://global.oup.com/booksites/content/9780198507185/">Discrete Mathematics by Norman L. Biggs</a>, whose excellent Chapter 7 gives a very clear overview of&nbsp;relations.</p>
