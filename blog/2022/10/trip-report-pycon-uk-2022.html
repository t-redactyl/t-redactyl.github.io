        <p>In-person conferences are finally getting back into full swing this year. Fortunately, four of the conferences I was accepted to speak at lined up back-to-back in late September. Even better, they were all in Europe! My first stop was <a href="https://2022.pyconuk.org/">PyCon <span class="caps">UK</span></a> in Cardiff. Despite coming back at reduced capacity this year, it was still a substantial conference, running for two and a half days and attracting around 700 people. In fact, it was completely sold&nbsp;out!</p>
<h2>Arrival/Day&nbsp;1</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to attend the first day of the conference, so I spent Friday traveling from Berlin to Cardiff instead. Much to the surprise of my colleagues in the <span class="caps">UK</span>, my flight options were limited because of the pandemic. The best I could find was a <span class="caps">KLM</span> flight that included a transfer via Schiphol, Amsterdam. I optimistically thought I might be able to arrive in time to catch the final talks of the first day, but due to the ongoing airport madness in Europe, I didn’t make it to my hotel until 6:30 pm, three hours behind schedule. However, my <a href="https://www.pontcannainn.com/">gorgeous accommodation</a> made up for it. After a long day’s travel, I was happy to be able to have a meal downstairs at the pub and then get to bed&nbsp;early.</p>

<h2>Day&nbsp;2</h2>
<p>I woke up to clear skies, which made for a very peaceful walk to the conference through the lovely Bute Park and past Cardiff&nbsp;Castle.</p>
<p><img src="/figure/pycon-uk-2022-1.png" title="Morning view of Cardiff Castle" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>I grabbed breakfast at a PyCon <span class="caps">UK</span> institution, <a href="https://brodiescoffee.co.uk/">Brodies</a>, which is situated just across from the conference venue in another small park. The conference was once again held in Cardiff City Hall, which is a beautiful 100-year old building situated close to Cardiff town&nbsp;center.</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The day started with a <a href="https://pretalx.com/pycon-uk-2022/talk/SLAQBH/">fantastic keynote</a> from <a href="https://twitter.com/drvinceknight">Vince Knight</a> about whether it’s ever possible to establish truth in&nbsp;research.</p>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/gilboy_tim">Tim Gilboy</a> and Reka Horvath from Sorcery then gave a talk on the <a href="https://pretalx.com/pycon-uk-2022/talk/KCWJKX/">cultural influences on technical debt</a>, which is similar to an issue I’ve talked about before in the context of improving reproducibility in data science research. This was followed by Alastair Stanley’s talk on <a href="https://pretalx.com/pycon-uk-2022/talk/GHLPMP/">how to get the most out of generators</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I really enjoyed Alastair Stanley&#39;s talk on working with generators.

<p>Phillippe Mason and Rita Kesrouani from JPMorgan gave an <a href="https://pretalx.com/pycon-uk-2022/talk/JBGRFC/">interesting overview</a> of how they help their non-developer analysts become more productive by using Python to access and use their data, all while having the largest Python codebase in the world. <a href="https://twitter.com/malemburg">Marc-André Lemburg</a> then gave a great <a href="https://pretalx.com/pycon-uk-2022/talk/EHRMFR/">introduction to async</a>, demonstrating when it might be helpful by showing us how to use it to build an anti-spam bot to clean up his Telegram&nbsp;group.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I was really looking forward to <a href="https://twitter.com/malemburg?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@malemburg</a>&#39;s talk on async in Python and it didn&#39;t disappoint!

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>I also gave <a href="https://pretalx.com/pycon-uk-2022/talk/TWJLXS/">my talk</a> on how to use some of NumPy’s vectorized operations to speed up your code, as well as explaining the linear algebra behind them (using <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/dataspell/">DataSpell</a> for my code demos,&nbsp;naturally!).</p>

<p>We ended the day with a hilarious <a href="https://pretalx.com/pycon-uk-2022/talk/7Q3PWL/">round of lightning talks</a>, where the winner was chosen based on decibel level and <a href="https://twitter.com/judy2k">Mark Smith</a> kept us entertained with increasingly bad tractor jokes. We then headed for some post-conference drinks at the trendy <a href="https://www.tinyrebel.co.uk/bars/cardiff">Tiny Rebel</a>, grabbed a bite at the <a href="https://www.thegrazingshed.com/">Grazing Shed</a>, and then popped into <a href="https://nq64.co.uk/cardiff/"><span class="caps">NQ64</span></a> for some arcade&nbsp;games.</p>
<h2>Day&nbsp;3</h2>
<p>The next day was also bright and sunny. I grabbed breakfast at the <a href="https://bute-park.com/attraction/summerhouse-cafe/">Summerhouse Café</a> in the park on the walk in. This final day of the conference was a half-day, so there was not as much on the agenda, but the talks were just as interesting. Some of the highlights for me were a talk from <a href="https://twitter.com/rebkwok">Becky Smith</a> and Simon Doxy about how they managed to <a href="https://pretalx.com/pycon-uk-2022/talk/EPCHLV/">quickly access and convert <span class="caps">COVID</span>-19 datasets</a> into anonymised, “research-ready” data that can be used by all researchers, and <a href="https://twitter.com/EliHolderness">Eli Holderness</a>’ <a href="https://pretalx.com/pycon-uk-2022/talk/NWR7CE/">hilarious and eye-opening talk</a> about some the surprises that pointers can throw at you in&nbsp;Python.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Absolutely brilliant talk by the wonderful <a href="https://twitter.com/EliHolderness?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@EliHolderness</a> about how pointers behave in Python.

<p>Sadly, Ian Thomas could not give his talk in full due to technical issues, but he presented a great slimmed-down version during the <a href="https://pretalx.com/pycon-uk-2022/talk/YAGBSK/">lightning talks</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">And it&#39;s a wrap for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PyConUK2022?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#PyConUK2022</a>! The last lightning talks were amazing and it was a great atmosphere up until the end. I had such a great time meeting old and new friends - can&#39;t wait to catch up with you all at the next PyCons. <a href="https://t.co/8b0x7r7F4b">pic.twitter.com/8b0x7r7F4b</a></p>&mdash; Jodie Burchell 🇦🇺🇩🇪 (@t_redactyl) <a href="https://twitter.com/t_redactyl/status/1571485861711171584?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 18, 2022</a></blockquote>

<p>After saying my goodbyes to old and new friends, I headed off to explore Cardiff a little in the afternoon, ending the day with a proper Sunday roast – including a delicious vegetarian Beef&nbsp;Wellington!</p>
<p><img src="/figure/pycon-uk-2022-2.png" title="Enjoying a traditional Sunday roast" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>This was my first PyCon <span class="caps">UK</span>, and I liked the conference a lot. In fact, my only regret was that I couldn’t attend all three days! As with all PyCons, the code of conduct was strictly enforced, and I felt welcomed and included by everyone. The conference put some nice touches in place to increase that inclusivity, including a crèche and a quiet room. The food was delicious, and there was plenty of it! Lunch was a huge spread of sandwiches, hot food, and desserts, and at each tea break they had these delicate little biscuits called <a href="https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/welsh-cakes">Welsh cakes</a>. I was also very impressed at how quickly the conference team processed the videos. Friday’s videos were already up on Saturday! Next year, the conference team is planning to return to a full, five-day conference, and I’m really looking forward to&nbsp;it.</p>
